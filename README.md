  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I started my journey in computer science driven by curiosity about how software systems really work — not just writing code, but understanding how applications run, scale, and survive in production. Early on, I focused heavily on backend development using Java and Spring Boot, where I learned how to design clean APIs, work with databases, and build reliable systems.

As I progressed, I realized that writing backend code was only part of the story. I became increasingly interested in what happens *after* the code is written: deployment, automation, reliability, and scalability. That curiosity naturally pulled me toward Linux, Bash scripting, Git, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization.

Today, I’m actively building myself as a backend engineer with strong DevOps foundations, aiming to grow into a Platform Engineer role — someone who not only builds services, but also designs the infrastructure and platforms that enable teams to ship software efficiently and reliably.

My long-term goal is to build production-ready systems and platforms that solve real problems, combining solid software engineering with modern DevOps and cloud-native practices. This journey is far from finished — but I’m committed to continuous learning, real-world projects, and getting better every day.
